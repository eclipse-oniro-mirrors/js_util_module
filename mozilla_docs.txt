All interfaces are described in d.ts, the following is the interface written in d.ts under to Mozilla license

class TextDecoder {
    readonly encoding: string;
    readonly fatal: boolean;
    readonly ignoreBOM = false;
    constructor(
        encoding?: string,
        options?: { fatal?: boolean; ignoreBOM?: boolean },
    );
    decode(input: Uint8Array, options?: { stream?: false }): string;
}

class TextEncoder {

    readonly encoding = "utf-8";
    constructor();
    encode(input?: string): Uint8Array;
    encodeInto(
        input: string,
        dest: Uint8Array,
    ): { read: number; written: number };
}
